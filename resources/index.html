                    <p><p>Helping women find their place, one woman at a time. Our Place, DC (Our Place) is a unique non-profit organization in the District of Columbia (DC) dedicated to providing gender-specific direct services and advocacy to help formerly and currently incarcerated women come back home from prison. We operate with a mission to support women who are or have been in the criminal justice system by providing the resources they need to maintain connections with the community, resettle after incarceration, and reconcile with their families. Our Place helps women remain drug and alcohol free, obtain decent housing and jobs, gain access to education, secure resources for their children, and maintain physical and emotional health with a goal of helping women succeed in the community rather than engage in behaviors that result in re-arrest.</p>

                    <p><p>Partnership for Safety and Justice (PSJ) is a multi-faceted, statewide advocacy organization based in Portland, Oregon.PSJ was founded in 1999 originally as the Western Prison Project. We have developed a pioneering and provocative model for our work – one that brings together all of those most directly affected by crime, violence and the criminal justice system (survivors of crime, people convicted of crime, and the families of both) to advocate for a system that is just and that more effectively builds safer, healthier communities.</p>

<p>We are the first advocacy organization in the country to unite all of these constituencies. We believe this approach offers a holistic perspective and a valuable strategy for shifting Oregon towards more effective, prevention-based approaches for creating community safety.</p>

This model meant that young women who were formerly incarcerated or working in the street economies had the support to become leaders, policymakers, researchers, employers, and activists. As a result, we have created a place for young women to come together, heal from past experiences, dream and achieve their visions for the future through leadership development, youth organizing, employment training, and health and wellness.&amp;quot</p>

                    <p><p>Founded in 1971, the PEN Prison Writing Program believes in the restorative and rehabilitative power of writing, by providing hundreds of inmates across the country with skilled writing teachers and audiences for their work. The program seeks to provide a place for inmates to express themselves freely with paper and pen and to encourage the use of the written word as a legitimate form of power. The program sponsors an annual writing contest, publishes a free handbook for prisoners, provides one-on-one mentoring to inmates whose writing shows merit or promise, conducts workshops for former inmates, and seeks to get inmates' work to the public through literary publications and readings.</p>

We have developed a pioneering and provocative model for our work – one that brings together all of those most directly affected by crime, violence and the criminal justice system (survivors of crime, people convicted of crime, and the families of both) to advocate for a system that is just and that more effectively builds safer, healthier communities.</p>

<p>We are the first advocacy organization in the country to unite all of these constituencies. We believe this approach offers a holistic perspective and a valuable strategy for shifting Oregon towards more effective, prevention-based approaches for creating community safety.</p>

                    <p><p>In 1974, women imprisoned at New York’s maximum-security prison at Bedford Hills staged what is known as the August Rebellion. Protesting the brutal beating of a fellow prisoner, the women fought off guards, holding seven of them hostage, and took over sections of the prison. Why do activists know about Attica but not the August Rebellion? Resistance Behind Bars documents collective organizing and individual resistance among women incarcerated in the U.S. and challenges the reader to question why these instances and efforts have been ignored and why many assume that women do not organize to demand change. It fills the gap in the existing literature, which has focused mostly on the causes, conditions and effects of female imprisonment. Women have significantly disrupted the daily operations of their prison to protest injustices and demand change. More often, however, they have employed less visible means such as forming peer education groups, clandestinely organizing ways for children to visit mothers in distant prisons and raising public awareness about their conditions. By emphasizing women's agency in resisting individually as well as organizing collectively against their conditions of confinement, Resistance will spark further discussion and research on incarcerated women's actions and also galvanize much-needed outside support for their struggle.</p>

The program seeks to provide a place for inmates to express themselves freely with paper and pen and to encourage the use of the written word as a legitimate form of power. The program sponsors an annual writing contest, publishes a free handbook for prisoners, provides one-on-one mentoring to inmates whose writing shows merit or promise, conducts workshops for former inmates, and seeks to get inmates' work to the public through literary publications and readings.</p>

We have developed a pioneering and provocative model for our work – one that brings together all of those most directly affected by crime, violence and the criminal justice system (survivors of crime, people convicted of crime, and the families of both) to advocate for a system that is just and that more effectively builds safer, healthier communities.</p>

<p>We are the first advocacy organization in the country to unite all of these constituencies. We believe this approach offers a holistic perspective and a valuable strategy for shifting Oregon towards more effective, prevention-based approaches for creating community safety.</p>

SRLP is a collective organization founded on the understanding that gender self-determination is inextricably intertwined with racial, social and economic justice. Therefore, we seek to increase the political voice and visibility of low-income people and people of color who are transgender, intersex, or gender non-conforming. SRLP works to improve access to respectful and affirming social, health, and legal services for our communities. We believe that in order to create meaningful political participation and leadership, we must have access to basic means of survival and safety from violence.</p>

<li>Collect and circulate many stories from different youth in Chicago about suspensions, expulsions, and the schoolhouse to jailhouse track.
<li>Learn from the surveys and the stories about what can be done to decrease suspensions and expulsions.
<li>Solicit and create art (visual and writing) that illustrates the connections between schools and jails and compile all of our information to create an interactive website.
<li>Increase our collective ability as youth to challenge the schoolhouse to jailhouse track in Rogers Park.

Our Place, DC (Our Place) is a unique non-profit organization in the District of Columbia (DC) dedicated to providing gender-specific direct services and advocacy to help formerly and currently incarcerated women come back home from prison. We operate with a mission to support women who are or have been in the criminal justice system by providing the resources they need to maintain connections with the community, resettle after incarceration, and reconcile with their families. Our Place helps women remain drug and alcohol free, obtain decent housing and jobs, gain access to education, secure resources for their children, and maintain physical and emotional health with a goal of helping women succeed in the community rather than engage in behaviors that result in re-arrest.</p>
